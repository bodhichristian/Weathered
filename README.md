A SwiftUI app for searching and displaying the weather. Weathered is built using MVVM architecture and ultilizes a WeatherService class for retrieving a JSON response from weatherapi.com. Users may save FavoriteLocations, with persistence from SwiftData. Upon initial app launch, user is prompted with enabling Location Services to enhance the MapKit experience.


### Running in the Simulator
* An API key from weatherapi.com is required to run the project with real data.
  * Enter your API Key in Weathered/Services/WeatherService

* Local conditions dictate the animations provided for the sky--including daylight, stars, clouds, rain, snow, and precipitation intensity
