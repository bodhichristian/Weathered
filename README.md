# Weathered

A SwiftUI app for searching and displaying the weather. Weathered is organized using MVVM architecture and ultilizes a WeatherService class for retrieving a JSON response from weatherapi.com. Users may save FavoriteLocations, with persistence from SwiftData.

* An API key from weatherapi.com is required to run the project with real data.
  * Enter your API Key in Weathered/Services/WeatherService

* Local conditions dictate the animations provided for the sky--including daylight, stars, clouds, rain, snow, and precipitation intensity
