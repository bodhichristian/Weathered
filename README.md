A SwiftUI app for searching and displaying the weather. Weathered is built using MVVM architecture and ultilizes a WeatherService class for retrieving a JSON response from weatherapi.com. Users may save FavoriteLocations, with persistence from SwiftData. Upon initial app launch, user is prompted with enabling Location Services to enhance the MapKit experience. Local conditions for searched cities dictate the animations provided for the sky--including daylight, stars, clouds, rain, snow, lightning, and condition intensity.


   

### ðŸ“² Running in the Simulator
* An API key from weatherapi.com is required to run the project with real data.
  * Enter your API Key in Weathered/Services/WeatherService. Instructions are in the file.
